    "text": "1.1 Sick burns\nIt’s been a couple of years since your local mayor proudly opened the new burns ward at your local hospital (Figure 1.1).\nThe unit is a modern, purpose-built 15 bed ward, with 11 side-rooms and two dual-bedded rooms (Figure 1.2). Any patients requiring mechanical ventilation or organ support are usually treated in two self-contained cubicles, located in the trauma critical care unit. As is typical in the UK, burns patients receive shower cart hydrotherapy as a central part of their treatment.\nUnfortunately, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous opportunistic pathogen in healthcare settings, and the ward has rapidly regressed to the mean situation of UK hospitals in which up to one in three burns patients become colonised with P. aeruginosa, typically leading to bacteraemia, soft tissue infection or pneumonia (Mahar et al. (2010), Reynolds and Kollef (2021), Roy et al. (2024), Figure 1.3).",

Outbreaks are frequently reported to be associated with water sources such as taps, showers, mixer valves, sink traps and drains (Trautmann, Lepper, and Haller (2005), Breathnach et al. (2012)). Outbreaks transmitted via water have resulted in fatal cases such as at a neonatal critical care unit in Belfast (Wise (2012)).\nYou are part of a team conducting an observational, prospective study into the occurrence and spread of P. aeruginosa on this burns ward. Patients were recruited from arrivals presenting with burns injuries covering greater than 7% of of their total body surface area.\nAll recruited patients were screened for whether they already carried P. aeruginosa in their wounds, urine, or stool. Samples were then taken from each patient during their stay on the ward. If P. aeruginosa was found while the patient was on the ward, then wound swabs and twice-weekly urine samples were taken from the patient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatient samples\n\n\n\n\nwound swabs\nurine\nstool\n\n\n\nSamples were also taken from the patient’s environment and water from outlets in their bed space, at weekly intervals, during their stay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment samples\n\n\n\n\nshower head rosette\nshower drain\nshower chair/trolley\ntap\nbedside table\npatient chair\ninstruments",

    "text": "Galaxy instances\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Galaxy software is open source and can be downloaded and installed freely on any computer that it can run on. Each such installation is called a Galaxy instance. The Galaxy instance that you will be working on is the EU Galaxy instance at https://usegalaxy.eu/. This is the largest Galaxy instance in Europe and gives access to over 2500 scientific tools. It is free to use, and is maintained by the Galaxy team at Freiburg.\nThere are many other Galaxy instances, some private, and some public and free for anyone to use, such as:\n\nhttps://usegalaxy.org/: The Galaxy Project public server, supporting biomedical research.\nhttps://galaxyproject.org/use/usegalaxy-fr/: A general-purpose Galaxy server, based in France\nhttps://galaxyproject.org/use/usegalaxy-au/: The Australian UseGalaxy server\n\nGalaxy can be thought of as a library of bioinformatics tools and, just as different libraries may contain differing collections of books, each Galaxy instance may make available different sets of tools, or different versions of similar tools. As a result some analyses may be possible on one Galaxy instance, but not another.\nWhen you use Galaxy it is important to be clear when writing up your analysis methods to be clear about which Galaxy instance is used, and which version of each tool was used in the analysis.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.1 Workflows\nThe key concept in Galaxy is the workflow. A workflow is a series, or chain, of analysis steps that takes some input data (one or more files or datasets) through a series of actions, to generate one or more result files. Typically, the output of one step will serve as the input to the next step, but more complicated branching workflows can also be created (Figure 2.1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Galaxy workflow editor view of a Galaxy workflow that runs the same tool (RXLR Motifs) with three different settings, and compares the results using a Venn diagram (reproduced from Cock et al. (2013)). The workflow runs from left to right. A single Input dataset is fed into the RXLR Motifs tool three times, applying a different method each time. Each run of the RXLR Motifs tool generates a different set of output sequences, which are passed as input to the Filter tool. The output from all three runs of the Filter tool is passed to the Venn Diagram tool, along with the original input dataset, to generate a Venn Diagram\n\n\n\nUsing Galaxy, you will build up a powerful bioinformatic analysis workflow to analyse your data, step-by-step, using a web browser. Galaxy allows you to save and share your workflows, to encourage reuse and reproducibility.",

Modern sequencing technologies usually give us high quality data, but it is still possible for some low-quality read sequences to be produced among the raw reads. So that these do not detrimentally affect the quality of our assembly, we first assess the quality of our read data, and then remove low-quality reads and low-quality parts of read sequences. The resulting dataset is often called the cleaned reads or processed reads.\nThis part of the workshop will cover the use of Falco to inspect the quality of your sequence reads.",

    "text": "6.2 Falco output\nThe output of Falco tells us a lot about the quality of our sequencing data, and we would typically use it to identify problems with our sequencing data. Some important sections are described below, and you can read more about how to diagnose quality issues in your dataset at the links below:\n\nOfficial FastQC documentation\nOfficial Falco documentation\nMichigan State University (MSU) FastQC tutorial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFalco and FastQC\n\n\n\nFalco and FastQC are two different tools, but they perform the same task and give equivalent, if visually distinct, output. Falco output is interpreted in exactly the same way as FastQC output, so it can be helpful to refer to FastQC tutorials and documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo: Inspecting Falco output in Galaxy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.1 Falco Summary\nThe Falco summary (Figure 6.1) provides an overview that indicates where there may be areas of concern in your data. Each section of the report receives a flag indicating either that it gets a pass (green, with a tick), a warning (amber, with exclamation mark), or a fail (red, with a cross) mark.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Example Falco summary showing passes for most sections of the report including “Basic Statistics,” warnings for some sections including “Sequence Length Distribution,” and a fail for “Per tile sequence quality”\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Per base sequence quality\nThe per base sequence quality plot (Figure 6.2) presents the ranges of individual base quality calls across the lengths of the input sequence reads. Higher scores (near 40) indicate better quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor good-quality sequence read data, we are looking for a graph where the mean quality (see Figure 6.2) is always showing green, with a score greater than 29.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Per base sequence quality score plot from Falco indicating high quality sequencing reads. Quality score ranges are presented as a boxplot at each sequence position range.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nIt is not unusual for the per-base quality scores to fall quite steeply towards the end of the reads, with Illumina and other sequencing technologies.\nIt is also typical for the quality score to be slightly lower in the first 5-7 bases of the read.\nIf mean quality per base falls below 29, there may be a problem with the sequencing data.\n\n\n\n\n6.2.3 Per sequence quality scores\nThe per sequence quality score (?fig-falco-perseq) summarises the distribution of high quality (higher scores, near 40) and lower quality reads in the complete dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn good quality sequence data, we tend to see a sharp peak towards the right hand side of the plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: Per sequence quality score plot from Falco indicating overall high quality sequencing reads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nIf the per sequence quality score appears flat, or plateaus towards the left hand side of the plot, there may be a problem with the sequencing data.",
