    "text": "Galaxy instances\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Galaxy software is open source and can be downloaded and installed freely on any computer that it can run on. Each such installation is called a Galaxy instance. The Galaxy instance that you will be working on is the EU Galaxy instance at https://usegalaxy.eu/. This is the largest Galaxy instance in Europe and gives access to over 2500 scientific tools. It is free to use, and is maintained by the Galaxy team at Freiburg.\nThere are many other Galaxy instances, some private, and some public and free for anyone to use, such as:\n\nhttps://usegalaxy.org/: The Galaxy Project public server, supporting biomedical research.\nhttps://galaxyproject.org/use/usegalaxy-fr/: A general-purpose Galaxy server, based in France\nhttps://galaxyproject.org/use/usegalaxy-au/: The Australian UseGalaxy server\n\nGalaxy can be thought of as a library of bioinformatics tools and, just as different libraries may contain differing collections of books, each Galaxy instance may make available different sets of tools, or different versions of similar tools. As a result some analyses may be possible on one Galaxy instance, but not another.\nWhen you use Galaxy it is important to be clear when writing up your analysis methods to be clear about which Galaxy instance is used, and which version of each tool was used in the analysis.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.1 Workflows\nThe key concept in Galaxy is the workflow. A workflow is a series, or chain, of analysis steps that takes some input data (one or more files or datasets) through a series of actions, to generate one or more result files. Typically, the output of one step will serve as the input to the next step, but more complicated branching workflows can also be created (Figure 1.1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Galaxy workflow editor view of a Galaxy workflow that runs the same tool (RXLR Motifs) with three different settings, and compares the results using a Venn diagram (reproduced from Cock et al. (2013)). The workflow runs from left to right. A single Input dataset is fed into the RXLR Motifs tool three times, applying a different method each time. Each run of the RXLR Motifs tool generates a different set of output sequences, which are passed as input to the Filter tool. The output from all three runs of the Filter tool is passed to the Venn Diagram tool, along with the original input dataset, to generate a Venn Diagram\n\n\n\nUsing Galaxy, you will build up a powerful bioinformatic analysis workflow to analyse your data, step-by-step, using a web browser. Galaxy allows you to save and share your workflows, to encourage reuse and reproducibility.",

    "text": "2.1 Sick burns\nIt’s been a couple of years since your local mayor proudly opened the new burns ward at your local hospital (Figure 2.1).\nThe unit is a modern, purpose-built 15 bed ward, with 11 side-rooms and two dual-bedded rooms (Figure 2.2). Any patients requiring mechanical ventilation or organ support are usually treated in two self-contained cubicles, located in the trauma critical care unit. As is typical in the UK, burns patients receive shower cart hydrotherapy as a central part of their treatment.\nUnfortunately, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous opportunistic pathogen in healthcare settings, and the ward has rapidly regressed to the mean situation of UK hospitals in which up to one in three burns patients become colonised with P. aeruginosa, typically leading to bacteraemia, soft tissue infection or pneumonia (Mahar et al. (2010), Reynolds and Kollef (2021), Roy et al. (2024), Figure 2.3).",

    "text": "2.2 The study\nIn a nosocomial setting P. aeruginosa especially affects patients with impaired immunity. Outbreaks are frequently reported to be associated with water sources such as taps, showers, mixer valves, sink traps and drains (Trautmann, Lepper, and Haller (2005), Breathnach et al. (2012)). Outbreaks transmitted via water have resulted in fatal cases such as at a neonatal critical care unit in Belfast (Wise (2012)).\nYou are part of a team conducting an observational, prospective study into the occurrence and spread of P. aeruginosa on this burns ward. Patients were recruited from arrivals presenting with burns injuries covering greater than 7% of of their total body surface area.\nAll recruited patients were screened for whether they already carried P. aeruginosa in their wounds, urine, or stool. Samples were then taken from each patient during their stay on the ward. If P. aeruginosa was found while the patient was on the ward, then wound swabs and twice-weekly urine samples were taken from the patient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatient samples\n\n\n\n\nwound swabs\nurine\nstool\n\n\n\nSamples were also taken from the patient’s environment and water from outlets in their bed space, at weekly intervals, during their stay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment samples\n\n\n\n\nshower head rosette\nshower drain\nshower chair/trolley\ntap\nbedside table\npatient chair\ninstruments",

Time in days is shown along the x axis. The y axis shows bed numbers in the burns unit (upper, Figure 2.2) and the critical care unity. Each circular icon indicates a positive isolate of P. aeruginosa. The letter in the icon indicates the MLST clade to which the P. aeruginosa sample belongs. The colour of the icon indicates the environment from which it was sampled: red = wound, purple = sputum, yellow = urine, blue = water, green = environment. Patient icons indicate individual patient enrolments in the study, and their locations (arrows indicate movement between beds). Boxes 1-5 indicate patients infected with P. aeruginosa.\n\n\n\nYour role, as the bioinformatician attached to the study, is to investigate the genome sequences of bacteria from these samples, and determine what evidence there is for transmission of P. aeruginosa to patients.\n\n\n\n\nBreathnach, A S, M D Cubbon, R N Karunaharan, C F Pope, and T D Planche. 2012. “Multidrug-Resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Outbreaks in Two Hospitals: Association with Contaminated Hospital Waste-Water Systems.” J.
