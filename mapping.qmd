# Read Mapping {@sec-mapping .unnumbered}

There are several approaches to comparison of genome sequences. One method is to align (or _map_) the sequenced reads from one genome to a different, reference genome. Reads will only _map to_ (align with) sequence-similar regions, so it is possible to inspect the alignments and see which parts of the two genomes are similar or dissimilar.

In this section, you will use this technique to compar the mapping of your isolate to a reference genome (_P. aeruginosa_ PA01) and to a sequenced isolate from the same study.
