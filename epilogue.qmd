## The Real Study

This workshop is based on a real study from 2014 (@Quick2014-kt).
The sequences you worked with are real sequences (you can look up the accession numbers at NCBI), and the ward layout is real.
Some details were changed slightly for pedagogical reasons, but by and large you've been doing the same kind of analysis as in that paper.
