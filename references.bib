  abstract  = "INTRODUCTION: We aimed to identify the risk factors for, and
               outcomes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteraemia in adult burns
               patients. METHOD: All adult burns patients who developed a
               Gram-negative bacteraemia over a period of 7 years were
               included. Retrospective data analysed included patient
               demographics, organisms cultured, antibiotic susceptibility
               patterns, isolation of P. aeruginosa in non-blood isolates,
               treatment, length of stay and mortality. RESULTS: Forty-three
               patients developed a Gram-negative bacteraemia over the study
               period, 12 of whom had Pseudomonas bacteraemia during the course
               of their admission. In eight patients (18.6\%) P. aeruginosa was
               the first Gram-negative isolated. The only factor predicting P.
               aeruginosa bacteraemia as a first episode (compared to another
               Gram-negative) was prior isolation of Pseudomonas at other sites
               (wound sites, urine or sputum). Overall length of stay was less
               in patients who developed P. aeruginosa as a first episode,
               mainly because of increased mortality in this group. Prior
               non-blood isolates of P. aeruginosa could have correctly
               predicted the sensitivity pattern of the strain of P. aeruginosa
               organism in 75\% of patients who did not receive appropriate
               initial antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Prior colonisation with P.
               aeruginosa predicts P. aeruginosa in blood cultures, as opposed
               to other Gram-negative bacteria. Clinicians should have a high
               index of suspicion for P. aeruginosa bacteraemia where a septic
               burns patient has a prior history of non-blood P. aeruginosa
               cultures. Empirical antibiotic regimes based on the
               antibiotic-sensitivity patterns of previous non-blood P.
               aeruginosa isolates in each patient should be given at the time
               blood cultures are taken.",

               Management of P. aeruginosa infections focuses on prevention

               patients have long been considered the most frequent source of P

               molecular typing methods made it possible, during the last

               significant source of exogenous P aeruginosa isolates. A review
               of prospective studies published between 1998 and 2005 showed
               that between 9.7\% and 68.1\% of randomly taken tap water

               expressing VIM-metallo-beta-lactamase is an emerging infection
               control problem. The source of many such infections is unclear,
               though there are reports of hospital outbreaks of P. aeruginosa
               related to environmental contamination, including tap water.
               AIM: We describe two outbreaks of MDR-P, sensitive only to
               colistin, in order to highlight the potential for hospital
               waste-water systems to harbour this organism. METHODS: The
               outbreaks were investigated by a combination of descriptive
               epidemiology, inspection and microbiological sampling of the
               environment, and molecular strain typing. FINDINGS: The
               outbreaks occurred in two English hospitals; each involved a
               distinct genotype of MDR-P. One outbreak was hospital-wide,
               involving 85 patients, and the other was limited to four cases
               in one specialized medical unit. Extensive environmental
               sampling in each outbreak yielded MDR-P only from the
               waste-water systems. Inspection of the environment and estates
               records revealed many factors that may have contributed to
               contamination of clinical areas, including faulty sink, shower
               and toilet design, clean items stored near sluices, and frequent
               blockages and leaks from waste pipes. Blockages were due to
               paper towels, patient wipes, or improper use of bedpan
               macerators. Control measures included replacing sinks and
               toilets with easier-to-clean models less prone to splashback,
               educating staff to reduce blockages and inappropriate storage,
               reviewing cleaning protocols, and reducing shower flow rates to
               reduce flooding. These measures were followed by significant
               reductions in cases. CONCLUSION: The outbreaks highlight the
               potential of hospital waste systems to act as a reservoir of
               MDR-P and other nosocomial pathogens.",

               Galaxy tools for large scale analysis of gene and protein

               of specific genes of interest in a range of non-model organisms,
               and our central example is the identification and prediction of
               ``effector'' proteins produced by plant pathogens in order to
               manipulate their host plant. This functional annotation of a
               pathogen's predicted capacity for virulence is a key step in
               translating sequence data into potential applications in plant
               pathology. This collection includes novel tools, and widely-used
               third-party tools such as NCBI BLAST+ wrapped for use within
               Galaxy. Individual bioinformatics software tools are typically
               available separately as standalone packages, or in online

               command line tools and scripting. Workflows created using Galaxy
