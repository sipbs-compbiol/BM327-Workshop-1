  abstract  = "INTRODUCTION: We aimed to identify the risk factors for, and
               outcomes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteraemia in adult burns
               patients. METHOD: All adult burns patients who developed a
               Gram-negative bacteraemia over a period of 7 years were
               included. Retrospective data analysed included patient
               demographics, organisms cultured, antibiotic susceptibility
               patterns, isolation of P. aeruginosa in non-blood isolates,
               treatment, length of stay and mortality. RESULTS: Forty-three
               patients developed a Gram-negative bacteraemia over the study
               period, 12 of whom had Pseudomonas bacteraemia during the course
               of their admission. In eight patients (18.6\%) P. aeruginosa was
               the first Gram-negative isolated. The only factor predicting P.
               aeruginosa bacteraemia as a first episode (compared to another
               Gram-negative) was prior isolation of Pseudomonas at other sites
               (wound sites, urine or sputum). Overall length of stay was less
               in patients who developed P. aeruginosa as a first episode,
               mainly because of increased mortality in this group. Prior
               non-blood isolates of P. aeruginosa could have correctly
               predicted the sensitivity pattern of the strain of P. aeruginosa
               organism in 75\% of patients who did not receive appropriate
               initial antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Prior colonisation with P.
               aeruginosa predicts P. aeruginosa in blood cultures, as opposed
               to other Gram-negative bacteria. Clinicians should have a high
               index of suspicion for P. aeruginosa bacteraemia where a septic
               burns patient has a prior history of non-blood P. aeruginosa
               cultures. Empirical antibiotic regimes based on the
               antibiotic-sensitivity patterns of previous non-blood P.
               aeruginosa isolates in each patient should be given at the time
               blood cultures are taken.",

               significant source of exogenous P aeruginosa isolates. A review
               of prospective studies published between 1998 and 2005 showed

               expressing VIM-metallo-beta-lactamase is an emerging infection
               control problem. The source of many such infections is unclear,
               though there are reports of hospital outbreaks of P. aeruginosa
               related to environmental contamination, including tap water.
               AIM: We describe two outbreaks of MDR-P, sensitive only to
               colistin, in order to highlight the potential for hospital
               waste-water systems to harbour this organism. METHODS: The
               outbreaks were investigated by a combination of descriptive
               epidemiology, inspection and microbiological sampling of the
               environment, and molecular strain typing. FINDINGS: The
               outbreaks occurred in two English hospitals; each involved a
               distinct genotype of MDR-P. One outbreak was hospital-wide,
               involving 85 patients, and the other was limited to four cases
               in one specialized medical unit. Extensive environmental
               sampling in each outbreak yielded MDR-P only from the
               waste-water systems. Inspection of the environment and estates
               records revealed many factors that may have contributed to
               contamination of clinical areas, including faulty sink, shower
               and toilet design, clean items stored near sluices, and frequent
               blockages and leaks from waste pipes. Blockages were due to
               paper towels, patient wipes, or improper use of bedpan
               macerators. Control measures included replacing sinks and
               toilets with easier-to-clean models less prone to splashback,
               educating staff to reduce blockages and inappropriate storage,
               reviewing cleaning protocols, and reducing shower flow rates to
               reduce flooding. These measures were followed by significant
               reductions in cases. CONCLUSION: The outbreaks highlight the
               potential of hospital waste systems to act as a reservoir of
               MDR-P and other nosocomial pathogens.",

               manipulate their host plant. This functional annotation of a

               translating sequence data into potential applications in plant
               pathology. This collection includes novel tools, and widely-used
               third-party tools such as NCBI BLAST+ wrapped for use within

               computational methods and substantial reductions in sequencing
               costs. Although this increasing breadth of draft genomes is
               providing key information regarding the evolutionary and
               functional diversity of microbial life, it has become
               impractical to finish all available reference genomes. Making
               robust biological inferences from draft genomes requires
               accurate estimates of their completeness and contamination.
               Current methods for assessing genome quality are ad hoc and
               generally make use of a limited number of ``marker'' genes
               conserved across all bacterial or archaeal genomes. Here we
               introduce CheckM, an automated method for assessing the quality
               of a genome using a broader set of marker genes specific to the
               position of a genome within a reference genome tree and
               information about the collocation of these genes. We demonstrate
               the effectiveness of CheckM using synthetic data and a wide
               range of isolate-, single-cell-, and metagenome-derived genomes.
               CheckM is shown to provide accurate estimates of genome
               completeness and contamination and to outperform existing
               approaches. Using CheckM, we identify a diverse range of errors
               currently impacting publicly available isolate genomes and
               demonstrate that genomes obtained from single cells and
               metagenomic data vary substantially in quality. In order to
               facilitate the use of draft genomes, we propose an objective
               measure of genome quality that can be used to select genomes

               internationally. Patients may become colonised or infected with
               P. aeruginosa after exposure to contaminated sources within the
               hospital environment. The aim of this study was to determine
               whether whole-genome sequencing (WGS) can be used to determine
               the source in a cohort of burns patients at high risk of P.
               aeruginosa acquisition. STUDY DESIGN: An observational
               prospective cohort study. SETTING: Burns care ward and critical
               care ward in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with >7\% total
               burns by surface area were recruited into the study. METHODS:
               All patients were screened for P. aeruginosa on admission and
               samples taken from their immediate environment, including water.
               Screening patients who subsequently developed a positive P.
               aeruginosa microbiology result were subject to enhanced
               environmental surveillance. All isolates of P. aeruginosa were
               genome sequenced. Sequence analysis looked at similarity and
               relatedness between isolates. RESULTS: WGS for 141 P. aeruginosa
               isolates were obtained from patients, hospital water and the
               ward environment. Phylogenetic analysis revealed eight distinct
               clades, with a single clade representing the majority of
               environmental isolates in the burns unit. Isolates from three
               patients had identical genotypes compared with water isolates
               from the same room. There was clear clustering of water isolates
               by room and outlet, allowing the source of acquisitions to be
               unambiguously identified. Whole-genome shotgun sequencing of
               biofilm DNA extracted from a thermostatic mixer valve revealed
               this was the source of a P. aeruginosa subpopulation previously
               detected in water. In the remaining two cases there was no clear
               link to the hospital environment. CONCLUSIONS: This study
               reveals that WGS can be used for source tracking of P.
               aeruginosa in a hospital setting, and that acquisitions can be
               traced to a specific source within a hospital ward.",

              available reference genomes in NCBI has more than tripled.
              Multiple genome alignment, the process of identifying nucleotides
              across multiple genomes which share a common ancestor, is used as
              the input to numerous downstream comparative analysis methods.
              Parsnp is one of the few multiple genome alignment methods able
              to scale to the current era of genomic data; however, there has
              been no major release since its initial release in
              2014.Results:To address this gap, we developed Parsnp v2, which
              significantly improves on its original release. Parsnp v2
              provides users with more control over executions of the program,
              allowing Parsnp to be better tailored for different use-cases. We
              introduce a partitioning option to Parsnp, which allows the input
              to be broken up into multiple parallel alignment processes which
              are then combined into a final alignment. The partitioning option
              can reduce memory usage by over 4x and reduce runtime by over 2x,
              all while maintaining a precise core-genome alignment. The
              partitioning workflow is also less susceptible to complications
              caused by assembly artifacts and minor variation, as alignment
              anchors only need to be conserved within their partition and not
              across the entire input set. We highlight the performance on
              datasets involving thousands of bacterial and viral genomes.",

               example, a new dataset type has been added (MEME motifs), while
               annotation options have been expanded for several existing ones.
               Node metadata display options have been extended and now also
               support non-numerical categorical values, as well as multiple
               values per node. Direct manual annotation is now available,
               providing a set of basic drawing and labeling tools, allowing
               users to draw shapes, labels and other features by hand directly
               onto the trees. Support for tree and dataset scales has been
               extended, providing fine control over line and label styles.
               Unrooted tree displays can now use the equal-daylight algorithm,
               proving a much greater display clarity. The user account system
               has been streamlined and expanded with new navigation options
               and currently handles >1 million trees from >70 000 individual
               users.",
