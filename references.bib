  abstract  = "INTRODUCTION: We aimed to identify the risk factors for, and
               outcomes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteraemia in adult burns
               patients. METHOD: All adult burns patients who developed a
               Gram-negative bacteraemia over a period of 7 years were
               included. Retrospective data analysed included patient
               demographics, organisms cultured, antibiotic susceptibility
               patterns, isolation of P. aeruginosa in non-blood isolates,
               treatment, length of stay and mortality. RESULTS: Forty-three
               patients developed a Gram-negative bacteraemia over the study
               period, 12 of whom had Pseudomonas bacteraemia during the course
               of their admission. In eight patients (18.6\%) P. aeruginosa was
               the first Gram-negative isolated. The only factor predicting P.
               aeruginosa bacteraemia as a first episode (compared to another
               Gram-negative) was prior isolation of Pseudomonas at other sites
               (wound sites, urine or sputum). Overall length of stay was less
               in patients who developed P. aeruginosa as a first episode,
               mainly because of increased mortality in this group. Prior
               non-blood isolates of P. aeruginosa could have correctly
               predicted the sensitivity pattern of the strain of P. aeruginosa
               organism in 75\% of patients who did not receive appropriate
               initial antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Prior colonisation with P.
               aeruginosa predicts P. aeruginosa in blood cultures, as opposed
               to other Gram-negative bacteria. Clinicians should have a high
               index of suspicion for P. aeruginosa bacteraemia where a septic
               burns patient has a prior history of non-blood P. aeruginosa
               cultures. Empirical antibiotic regimes based on the
               antibiotic-sensitivity patterns of previous non-blood P.
               aeruginosa isolates in each patient should be given at the time
               blood cultures are taken.",

               significant source of exogenous P aeruginosa isolates. A review
               of prospective studies published between 1998 and 2005 showed

               expressing VIM-metallo-beta-lactamase is an emerging infection
               control problem. The source of many such infections is unclear,
               though there are reports of hospital outbreaks of P. aeruginosa
               related to environmental contamination, including tap water.
               AIM: We describe two outbreaks of MDR-P, sensitive only to
               colistin, in order to highlight the potential for hospital
               waste-water systems to harbour this organism. METHODS: The
               outbreaks were investigated by a combination of descriptive
               epidemiology, inspection and microbiological sampling of the
               environment, and molecular strain typing. FINDINGS: The
               outbreaks occurred in two English hospitals; each involved a
               distinct genotype of MDR-P. One outbreak was hospital-wide,
               involving 85 patients, and the other was limited to four cases
               in one specialized medical unit. Extensive environmental
               sampling in each outbreak yielded MDR-P only from the
               waste-water systems. Inspection of the environment and estates
               records revealed many factors that may have contributed to
               contamination of clinical areas, including faulty sink, shower
               and toilet design, clean items stored near sluices, and frequent
               blockages and leaks from waste pipes. Blockages were due to
               paper towels, patient wipes, or improper use of bedpan
               macerators. Control measures included replacing sinks and
               toilets with easier-to-clean models less prone to splashback,
               educating staff to reduce blockages and inappropriate storage,
               reviewing cleaning protocols, and reducing shower flow rates to
               reduce flooding. These measures were followed by significant
               reductions in cases. CONCLUSION: The outbreaks highlight the
               potential of hospital waste systems to act as a reservoir of
               MDR-P and other nosocomial pathogens.",

               manipulate their host plant. This functional annotation of a

               translating sequence data into potential applications in plant
               pathology. This collection includes novel tools, and widely-used
               third-party tools such as NCBI BLAST+ wrapped for use within

               Illumina sequence reads as compressed FASTQ files or
               pre-assembled contigs in raw, FASTA, or GenBank format.
               Alternatively, users can supply a GenBank accession or a
               previously generated Proksee map in JSON format. Proksee then
               performs assembly (for raw sequence data), generates a graphical
               map, and provides an interface for customizing the map and
               launching further analysis jobs. Notable features of Proksee
               include unique and informative assembly metrics provided via a
               custom reference database of assemblies; a deeply integrated
               high-performance genome browser for viewing and comparing
               analysis results at individual base resolution (developed

               that is one of the top three causes of opportunistic human
               infections. A major factor in its prominence as a pathogen is
               its intrinsic resistance to antibiotics and disinfectants. Here
               we report the complete sequence of P. aeruginosa strain PAO1. At
               6.3 million base pairs, this is the largest bacterial genome

               the versatility and intrinsic drug resistance of P. aeruginosa.
               Consistent with its larger genome size and environmental
               adaptability, P. aeruginosa contains the highest proportion of
               regulatory genes observed for a bacterial genome and a large
               number of genes involved in the catabolism, transport and efflux

  abstract  = "Large-scale recovery of genomes from isolates, single cells, and
               metagenomic data has been made possible by advances in
               computational methods and substantial reductions in sequencing
               costs. Although this increasing breadth of draft genomes is
               providing key information regarding the evolutionary and
               functional diversity of microbial life, it has become
               impractical to finish all available reference genomes. Making
               robust biological inferences from draft genomes requires
               accurate estimates of their completeness and contamination.
               Current methods for assessing genome quality are ad hoc and
               generally make use of a limited number of ``marker'' genes
               conserved across all bacterial or archaeal genomes. Here we
               introduce CheckM, an automated method for assessing the quality
               of a genome using a broader set of marker genes specific to the
               position of a genome within a reference genome tree and
               information about the collocation of these genes. We demonstrate
               the effectiveness of CheckM using synthetic data and a wide
               range of isolate-, single-cell-, and metagenome-derived genomes.
               CheckM is shown to provide accurate estimates of genome
               completeness and contamination and to outperform existing
               approaches. Using CheckM, we identify a diverse range of errors
               currently impacting publicly available isolate genomes and
               demonstrate that genomes obtained from single cells and
               metagenomic data vary substantially in quality. In order to
               facilitate the use of draft genomes, we propose an objective
               measure of genome quality that can be used to select genomes
               suitable for specific gene- and genome-centric analyses of
               microbial communities.",
